# Gluon-mechanism Project Code of Conduct

## Welcome

Welcome to the **Gluon-mechanism** repository! This project is focused on providing a seamless login system that respects user privacy, secures their work data, and grants immutable ownership rights. We are dedicated to maintaining a respectful, inclusive, and harassment-free community for all contributors and participants. As we work towards decentralization and user data ownership, we believe that creating a positive environment is key to the success of the project.

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act in ways that contribute to a safe, open, diverse, and secure community. Our project is committed to safeguarding user privacy and data integrity while fostering collaboration and respect within the community.

## Our Standards

To create a positive environment and ensure the success of **Gluon-mechanism**, all community members are expected to adhere to the following standards:

### Positive Behavior:
- **Respect User Privacy**: Ensure that all discussions and contributions align with our goal of respecting and protecting user privacy. 
- **Integrity**: Act with honesty and uphold the principle of user ownership rights, which is central to our project’s mission.
- **Collaboration**: Collaborate openly to help integrate decentralized technologies, such as IPFS and Solana, into the project.
- **Constructive Feedback**: Provide feedback with the goal of improving both the project and the community experience.
- **Inclusive Language**: Use language that encourages inclusion and makes all contributors feel welcome, regardless of their background or experience.
- **Empathy**: Be considerate of others' viewpoints and experiences, and engage in discussions with empathy and understanding.
- **Accountability**: Own your mistakes, learn from them, and strive to grow both personally and within the community.

### Unacceptable Behavior:
- **Disrespecting Privacy**: Any behavior that compromises user privacy or fails to respect the core goals of secure data storage and ownership.
- **Harassment**: Unwelcome advances, inappropriate comments, or any form of abusive behavior.
- **Plagiarism**: Misrepresenting others' work as your own, which directly violates the core aim of protecting ownership rights. Addressing plagiarism is a key priority in this project.
- **Discrimination**: Engaging in discriminatory language or actions based on personal identity, beliefs, or background.
- **Disruption**: Engaging in behavior that disrupts or undermines community discussions or the collaborative spirit of the project.
- **Ethical Violations**: Misusing community resources or misrepresenting contributions in a way that compromises the integrity of the project.

## Project Goals

The **Gluon-mechanism** project has three primary aims:

### Aim 1: Providing a Secure Location for Storing Users' Work Data and Content
We are integrating **IPFS** (InterPlanetary File System) into our Next.js app to provide a decentralized and secure storage solution. All user data will be stored in an IPFS database, ensuring privacy and security for the content and work data contributed by users.

### Aim 2: Providing Immutable Ownership to Users
Using **Solana** blockchain technology, we will ensure that users have indisputable ownership of their work and content. Solana’s decentralized architecture provides permanent ownership rights, aligning with our goal of empowering users with true ownership.

### Aim 3: Addressing Plagiarism
We are exploring various options, including leveraging **AI algorithms**, to prevent plagiarism and protect the integrity of user-generated content. While we have yet to finalize this solution, it remains a high priority to ensure fairness and ownership across the platform.
